Details Regarding transactions being employed in the database:

/*Staff creation:
We have modeled all details related to Staff i.e. Their Staff ID, Name, Date of Registration etc. in the Staff Table, and thier
Logon Credentials in a seperate table [Application.Credentials] hence we need a transaction to make sure that whenever a staff is
created (either a technician or a receptionist or anyone from the admin) they need to signup using their BioData and the Signup
details at the same time.
Begin Transaction{
	Create User
	Create User Credentials
	Commit
}

Blood Inventory Updatation:
Whenever a pending request for a specific type of blood is attended there has to be a decrease in the inventory, to maintain the
Consistency. Hence we have created a transaction:
Begin Transaction{
	Approve Blood Request
	Update that specific blood type inventory
	Commit
}
*/
